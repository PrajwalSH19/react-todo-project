## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- [elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/)
- [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev/)
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindui.com/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I have learned many things from this challange like using different Js library and elf for state management and RxJS etc, I could enhance my designing skills and problem-solving skills.If you want to be a great developer, you have to be curious and learn new things every day.

### Useful resources

- ([elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/)) - There are many libs for state management, but Elf have a good point than other.It's independent, no bind to FW, you can use everywhere. Share the same class to many projects.

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindui.com/)- This helped me for styling reason.Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
